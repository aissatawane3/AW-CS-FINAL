# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Photography Portfolio

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A site that allows you to view/browse my photo collection.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want it to be a site that conveys my work in a professional and organized manner. It would have a menu with options to choose from. It won't be anything fancy just a profile, gallery, and contact info.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website that I can display my work on.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A site that has layers where you can surf through my work based on topics, not just a quick look on one page.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A polished website that I can use in an official setting/capacity.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'll have to reference other people's processes and see what will be the clearest path I can take. I'll need to learn how to navigate acquiring a site that belongs to me/only I have access to. Once I have a platform I can move forward with cutomizing my site. I will have to make it look nice on top of being functional. In the case of photography, aesthetics matter way more than if you were just making a game of pac-man so that will be a challenge I'll face.
